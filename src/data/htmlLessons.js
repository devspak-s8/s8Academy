    title: "What is HTML?",
    content: `
HTML, or **HyperText Markup Language**, is the foundational language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web.

It is a **markup language**, which means it uses tags to describe elements like text, images, and links. “HyperText” allows linking between documents, enabling non-linear navigation.

HTML is **not** a programming language. It’s used to structure and describe content, not add logic or interactivity (that’s JavaScript's job).

HTML was invented by **Tim Berners-Lee** around 1989, and the current standard is **HTML5**, which introduced multimedia features and better semantics.

#### Example Tag
\`\`\`html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
\`\`\`

#### HTML Works With:
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for interactivity

This is your first step into the world of web development, where HTML gives structure, CSS gives beauty, and JavaScript gives brains.
